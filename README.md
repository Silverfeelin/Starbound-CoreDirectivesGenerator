# Starbound Core Directives Generator

A .NET Core port of [Silverfeelin/Starbound-DirectiveGenerator](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/Starbound-DirectiveGenerator/).

This tool is used to compare two image files to generate `?replace` directives for use in Starbound. This allows you to work with your preferred image editing software.

## Notes
* Images should be recolored using external software. Some great applications are [Paint.NET](http://www.getpaint.net/index.html) and [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/).
* A color should only ever be replaced by one other color.
 * In Paint.NET, I recommend the below settings for the Paint Bucket tool.

## Installation

On the release page, make sure you download the zip for your platform (i.e. `win-x86`).

### Windows

* Unpack the zip.

You can now run the application simply by opening `CoreDirectivesGenerator.exe`.

### Mac & Linux

* Unpack the zip.
* Open the terminal and navigate to the folder.
* Mark the application as executable with `chmod +x CoreDirectivesGenerator`.

You can now run the application by entering `./CoreDirectivesGenerator` in your terminal (make sure you open your terminal from inside the application folder).

## Usage

> Note that you can drag an image file directly on top of the console to get the image path!

* Enter the image path of your source image and press enter.
* Enter the image path of your recolored image and press enter.
* Paste the generated directives from your clipboard somewhere using <kbd>Ctrl + V</kbd> or <kbd>âŒ˜ + V</kbd>.
  * Depending on your image size, it may take a moment before the directives are generated.

To quit the application, either enter `quit` or kill the process using <kbd>Ctrl + C</kbd>.
